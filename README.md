# Markdown to clipboard

Renders selected markdown into rich text in your clipboard, so that you can paste it as a formatted text to any rich text application.

## Motivation

As for programmer I prefer to write stuff quickly in markdown. Be it email, docs, specs - you name it. Some apps, e.g. my e-mail client doesn't support markdown and are just PITA to use, so I actually create a msg in vscode and then paste it into the email.

## Known Issues

* Currently it works only on Windows, using powershell cmd. **Pull requests are welcome.**
* Doesn't put plain text, just HTML mime type.
